*Bachelor of Science in Computer Science* at **Florida International University** (Miami, Florida) with a 
GPA of *3.81*.
 
`Anticipated Graduation: Fall 2016`
 
    Enrolled in the 4+1 accelerated program that allows advanced undergraduate students to take 
    graduate-level courses to count towards both their undergraduate and graduate degrees, resulting in a 
    five-year curriculum compared to the traditional six.

**2009-2013**
*High School Diploma* at **Miami Lakes Educational Center** (Miami Lakes, Florida) with a GPA of *3.60*.

    Received OCP-D Electronics Technician certification through specialized academic program.

Work Experience
---------------
**2015-**
*Student Research Assistant* for **High Performance Database Research Center** (Miami, Florida)  

    Managed, led, and contributed towards various geospatial-related projects - especially those related
	to Terrafly, a set of technologies utilized for the visualization and querying of geospatial data. 
	Maintained spatial keyword legacy system by loading, testing, and debugging datasets. Edited and
	rewrote parts of the legacy system's Java code to solve relevant loading and testing issues or 
	increase the efficiency/responsiveness of web services. 
    
    Wrote small scripts and software tools in C, Python, HTML, and Javascript to automate and/or reduce 
    complexity and time of maintainence tasks. Performed and helped to write research in the area of 
    geospatial database algorithms - especially join operations, nearest neighbor and range queries, and 
	index structures. Hosted and led seminars regarding good coding practices as well as database-related
	algorithms such as DBSCAN.

**2014-2015**
*Private Tutor* for **LOVECHILD Development & Transition Partners** (Hallandale Beach, Florida)

    Coordinated and led private in-home tutoring sessions for K-12 students in subjects such as Reading, 
    Writing, and Math. Focused on reading comprehension, persuasive writing skills, and basic mathematical
    concepts. Helped students to prepare for FCAT by proctoring and reviewing practice exams.

Projects
--------
**Learning OpenFlow/SDN network for R&E Ver 1.0.**: *A project for learning and developing for SDN networks.*

    Contributing as an author towards various Python scripts used for testing and validating 
	software-defined networks, especially that of Americas Lightpaths (AmLight) - a networking project 
	used to connect the U.S., Latin America, and parts of Europe for research and education (R&E).
	Primarily leveraging technologies such as OESS to allow for a remote OpenFlow controller for the
	virtual AmLight network recreated in the Mininet VM. Serving as the development team lead, utilizing
	the Agile/Scrum methodology for rapid development. 

**mpdbn**: *A multithreaded database normalization program.*  

    Contributing as the sole author towards a program that normalizes a relational database given a
	universal set of attributes and functional dependencies, using multithreading to provide fast results.

**fetchit**: *A YouTube video and audio downloading service.*  

    Contributed as the sole author towards an application that allows for the dynamic downloading and 
    transferring of YouTube web content (video and audio) in various formats via any FTP client. The
	application consists of an FTP server implemented in C and a download service implemented in Python -
	both using multiprocessing for serving concurrent users. It heavily relies on the backend of 
	open-source projects youtube-dl and Pafy to fetch and download YouTube streams.
  
**MyFIUPrediction**: *An application and library for predicting student grades.*  

    Contributed as an author towards an open-source statistical engine and library implemented in C++,
	which is then used as part of the backend for a wrapper for my.fiu.edu. The statistical engine uses a
	popular Machine Learning algorithm J48 Decision Tree to smartly predict student grades, using their
	transcripts as training data. The library is made to be heavily extensible, abstracting the type of
	classification algorithm and the way the training data is received.

Activities
----------
**Google RISE 4 CS**: *Project Manager, Webinar Leader, and Mentor for underprivileged high school CS
students.*  

    Managed and led a Google-funded project pioneered by Georgia Tech to increase the involvement and
	success of underprivledged high school minorities in the field of Computer Science. For two years,
	planned and hosted webinars and in-person meetings to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A
	Exam. Additionally, coordinated fun Java projects with co-leaders and co-managers for students to 
	participate in.
  
**FIU STARS**: *Student Organization Treasurer & Tutor and Mentor for undergraduate CS students.*  

    Served as a treasurer for a FIU STARS - a student-led organization dedicated to public service and
	active engagement in the fields of Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Tutored and mentored
	undergraduate CS students in various CS and math courses. Dedicated over 100 hours of public service
	to the organization and the CS community.
