Career Objective
----------------

    To establish career development through solving intellectually challenging problems as a team player
    in various subfields including - but not limited to - databases and data mining as well as 
    engineering and developing effective and efficient software for clients and other developers. 

Education
---------

**2016-**
*Master of Science in Computer Science* at **Florida International Univeristy** (Miami, Florida)

**> Anticipated Graduation: Fall 2017**

**2013-**
*Bachelor of Science in Computer Science* at **Florida International University** (Miami, Florida) with a GPA of 3.81.
 
**> Anticipated Graduation: Fall 2016**
 
    Enrolled in the 4+1 accelerated program that allows advanced undergraduate students to take 
    graduate-level courses to count towards both their undergraduate and graduate degrees, resulting in a 
    5-year graduation compared to the traditional 6-year graduation.

**2009-2013**
*High School Diploma* at **Miami Lakes Educational Center** (Miami Lakes, Florida) with a GPA of 3.60.

    Received OCP-D Electronics Technician certification through specialized academic program.

Work Experience
---------------
**2015-**
*Student Research Assistant* for **High Performance Database Research Center** (Miami, Florida)  

    Managed, led, and contributed towards various geospatial-related projects - especially those related to 
    Terrafly, a set of technologies utilized for the visualization and querying of geospatial data. Maintained
    spatial keyword legacy system by loading, testing, and debugging datasets. Edited and rewrote parts of the
    legacy system's Java code to solve relevant loading and testing issues or increase the 
    efficiency/responsiveness of web services. 
    
    Wrote small scripts and software tools in C, Python, HTML, and Javascript to automate and/or reduce 
    complexity and time of maintainence tasks. Performed and helped to write research in the area of 
    geospatial database algorithms - especially join operations, nearest neighbor and range queries, and index 
    structures. Hosted and led seminars regarding good coding practices as well as database-related algorithms
    such as DBSCAN.

**2014-2015**
*Private Tutor* for **LOVECHILD Development & Transition Partners** (Hallandale Beach, Florida)

    Coordinated and led private in-home tutoring sessions for K-12 students in subjects such as Reading, 
    Writing, and Math. Focused on reading comprehension, persuasive writing skills, and basic mathematical
    concepts. Helped students to prepare for FCAT by proctoring and reviewing practice exams.

Projects
--------
**mpdbn**: *A multithreaded database normalization program.*  

    Contributing as the sole author towards a program that normalizes a relational database given a universal 
    set of attributes and functional dependencies, using multithreading to provide fast results.

**fetchit**: *A YouTube video and audio downloading service.*  

    Contributed as the sole author towards an application that allows for the dynamic downloading and 
    transferring of YouTube web content (video and audio) in various formats via any FTP client. The application
    consists of an FTP server implemented in C and a download service implemented in Python - both using 
    multiprocessing for serving concurrent users. It heavily relies on the backend of open-source projects
    youtube-dl and Pafy to fetch and download YouTube streams.
  
**MyFIUPrediction**: *An application and library for predicting student grades.*  

    Contributed as an author towards an open-source statistical engine and library implemented in C++, which is
    then used as part of the backend for a wrapper for my.fiu.edu. The statistical engine uses a popular Machine
    Learning algorithm J48 Decision Tree to smartly predict student grades, using their transcripts as training 
    data. The library is made to be heavily extensible, abstracting the type of classification algorithm and the
    way the training data is received.

Activities
----------
**Google RISE 4 CS**: *Project Manager, Webinar Leader, and Mentor for underprivileged high school CS students.*  

    Managed and led a Google-funded project pioneered by Georgia Tech to increase the involvement and success
    of underprivledged high school minorities in the field of Computer Science. In particular, planned and 
    hosted webinars and in-person meetings to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A Exam for 2 years. 
    Additionally, coordinated fun Java projects with co-leaders and co-managers for students to participate in.
  
**FIU STARS**: *Student Organization Treasurer & Tutor and Mentor for undergraduate CS students.*  

    Served as a treasurer for a FIU STARS - a student-led organization dedicated to public service and active 
    engagement in the field of Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Tutored and mentored undergraduate CS
    students in various CS and math courses. Dedicated over 100 hours of public service to the organization and
    the CS community.
